# Who Am I?
My name is Chieh-Hsiu Hung, I came from Taiwan is aspires to be a software engineer.
Growing up, one idea I lived with is the Chinese term 
> 山不转水转 水不转人转

This saying meant that when things are not working in a way you wish, tackle it from a different perspective.
This flexible mindset not only allowed me to think outside the box, it also enabled me to take in others; opinions and perspectives easier.
